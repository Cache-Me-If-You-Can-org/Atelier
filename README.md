# Atelier Project

## Setup

 The intial setup for this app for now is simply obtaining the dependacies.

 Inside of the root directory of the app (```path/to/Atelier```) open the terminal and execute ```npm install``` (you must have NodeJS on your machine)

 Once you install the dependencies you can run ```npm start``` which will start the live server for the app.

 After the server is running, all you have to do is open your local server in a browser (by default it's ```http://localhost:3000/```)
